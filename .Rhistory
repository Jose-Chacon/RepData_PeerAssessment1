# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

# indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
# Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis)
# and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
# See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
